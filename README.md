# G16-MarieAlcantara-Assessment
Background
Galvanize Eats is a food service that delivers burgers and pizza on demand. You are building their new site, which includes a light ordering web app. The landing page of the site should you tell you some basic information about the company, while the web app should show you a sorted list of menu items, allow you to build an order, enter in your delivery information, and submit the order to Galvanize Eats. Your product owner has created a list of prioritized user stories for you to work down.

Screenshots
The finished product should look something like this:

Import stories into Pivotal Tracker
Import this CSV into a new project in Pivotal Tracker to get the requirements for this story. They are sorted into two epics that roughly align with the two pages, and they are prioritized. You may find it useful to size the stories before you begin.

Use the Galvanize Eats repo as a base
Fork/clone this repo. You are required to use this repo and keep this folder structure.

APIs
The project involves two API calls. The first, to get the menu data should be a GET request to this url: https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/menu. The second request, to post an order, should be a POST request to this url: https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/orders. When you have successfully hit the POST api you will see "Congratulations!".
